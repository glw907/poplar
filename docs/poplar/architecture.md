# Poplar Architecture

Living architecture record for the poplar email client. Updated after
each implementation pass with decisions made and rationale.

## Overview

Poplar is a bubbletea-based terminal email client that lives in the
beautiful-aerc monorepo. It reuses the existing filter, theme, and
compose infrastructure and adds forked aerc worker code for mail
protocol handling (IMAP + JMAP).

| Layer | Package | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| UI | `internal/ui/` | Bubbletea components (topline, sidebar, msglist, viewer, statusbar, footer) |
| Mail adapter | `internal/mail/` | `Backend` interface, poplar-native types, account lifecycle |
| Poplar config | `internal/poplar/` | AccountConfig struct, poplar-specific types |
| Forked workers | `internal/aercfork/worker/` | Forked aerc IMAP + JMAP workers |
| Forked models | `internal/aercfork/models/` | Forked aerc data types |
| Forked support | `internal/aercfork/{log,parse,xdg,auth,keepalive}/` | Forked aerc support libraries |
| Content pipeline | `internal/filter/` | CleanHTML/CleanPlain: raw email → normalized markdown |
| Block model | `internal/content/` | ParseBlocks, RenderBody, ParseHeaders, RenderHeaders |
| Themes | `internal/theme/` | Compiled lipgloss themes (15 themes, One Dark default) |
| Compose | `internal/compose/` | Existing compose buffer normalization (shared with mailrender) |
| Config | `internal/config/` | Poplar config parsing (accounts, UI, keybindings) |

## Key Decisions

### Monorepo over separate repo
**Decision:** Poplar lives in beautiful-aerc, not its own repo.
**Rationale:** Shares filter, theme, and compose code as library
calls. Avoids cross-repo version coordination during development.
Mailrender can be gradually retired as poplar subsumes its
functionality.
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### Clean fork over direct import
**Decision:** Fork aerc's worker code rather than importing aerc as
a Go dependency.
**Rationale:** Aerc doesn't maintain a stable library API — internal
packages change without warning. A fork with upstream tracking
(cherry-pick protocol fixes) is more stable than chasing breaking
`go get -u` updates.
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### External editor only
**Decision:** No built-in compose editor. Always launch `$EDITOR`
(nvim-mail) via `tea.ExecProcess`.
**Rationale:** Building an inline editor in bubbletea is a massive
effort for marginal benefit. nvim-mail already provides the exact
compose UX we want. Simplifies the UI significantly.
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### Compiled lipgloss themes over TOML
**Decision:** Themes are compiled Go values (`Palette` → `NewCompiledTheme`
→ `*CompiledTheme` with lipgloss.Style fields), not runtime TOML files.
Glamour dependency removed entirely.
**Rationale:** Follows Charm conventions (lipgloss styles as Go values).
Eliminates runtime file discovery, TOML parsing errors, and the
glamour→lipgloss impedance mismatch. Three-layer pipeline: filter
(CleanHTML/CleanPlain) → content (ParseBlocks) → renderer (RenderBody
with lipgloss). Poplar and mailrender share the same compiled themes.
**Date:** 2026-04-10 (Pass 2.5-render)

### Command footer in all tabs
**Decision:** Every tab displays a persistent footer showing available
commands grouped by function. Format: `c:compose  j/k:move  d:delete`
etc. Poplar is opinionated about keybindings — the footer is the
primary discoverability mechanism, not a help page.
**Rationale:** Terminal email clients have steep learning curves.
A visible command reference eliminates guesswork without requiring
a manual. Grouping by function (navigation, triage, compose, search)
makes the footer scannable. The footer content changes per tab context
(message list commands differ from viewer commands).
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### Status indicator for transient feedback
**Decision:** A status area displays transient messages for user
actions: "Message sent", "Draft saved", "Deleted 3 messages", etc.
Positioned above the command footer (or integrated into the tab bar
area) so it doesn't displace the persistent command hints.
**Rationale:** Without feedback, destructive or async actions feel
uncertain — did the send actually go through? A brief, auto-dismissing
status message confirms the action completed. Covers sends, drafts,
deletes, archive, moves, errors, and connection state changes.
**Implementation:** Open question — could be an inline status bar
region, a toast-style overlay, or a brief modal. Decide during
implementation based on what looks best in bubbletea. Modern TUI
convention leans toward toast overlays (bottom-right, auto-dismiss
after 2-3s) but the right choice depends on how the layout feels.
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### Fork namespace: internal/aercfork/
**Decision:** All forked aerc code lives under `internal/aercfork/`
rather than directly in `internal/`.
**Rationale:** Makes the fork boundary visible (ours vs aerc's),
simplifies cherry-picks (clear mapping to aerc source tree), and
avoids name collisions with existing `internal/` packages like
`internal/jmap/` (fastmail-cli's JMAP client).
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 1)

### Minimal AccountConfig
**Decision:** Replace aerc's 50+ field `config.AccountConfig` with
a minimal `poplar.AccountConfig` (15 fields) in `internal/poplar/`.
**Rationale:** Workers only access Name, Source, Params, Folders,
Headers, HeadersExclude, CheckMail, and identity fields. The rest
(PGP, AuthRes, CheckMailCmd, etc.) is unused by IMAP/JMAP workers
or handled differently by poplar. Smaller surface = easier to
maintain and understand.
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 1)

### Split aerc lib/ into focused packages
**Decision:** aerc's monolithic `lib/` package was split into focused
packages: `auth/` (OAuth), `keepalive/` (TCP), `xdg/` (paths),
`log/` (logging), `parse/` (headers).
**Rationale:** aerc's `lib/` is a grab-bag of unrelated utilities.
Splitting by concern makes dependencies explicit and avoids pulling
in UI-specific code (messageview, dirstore, etc.) that lives in the
same package.
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 1)

### JMAP + IMAP only (v1)
**Decision:** Target Gmail (IMAP) and Fastmail (JMAP) only. No
maildir, mbox, or notmuch backends.
**Rationale:** Covers the vast majority of real-world users. Smaller
extraction surface from aerc. Backend interface is pluggable — other
backends can be added later if there's demand.
**Date:** 2026-04-09

### Synchronous adapter over async
**Decision:** The `mail.Backend` interface uses synchronous blocking
methods. The JMAP adapter bridges the forked worker's async
message-passing (channels + callbacks) to blocking calls via a pump
goroutine.
**Rationale:** Bubbletea's `tea.Cmd` model handles async naturally —
blocking calls run in commands that return messages on completion.
Synchronous methods are simpler to reason about and test than
channel-based APIs. The pump goroutine reads from the worker's
response channel and dispatches registered callbacks; `doAction`
blocks on a per-call channel until Done/Error arrives.
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 2)

### Config in ~/.config/poplar/
**Decision:** Poplar config lives in `~/.config/poplar/accounts.toml`,
separate from aerc's config.
**Rationale:** Allows both clients to coexist during development.
The TOML format matches the theme files for consistency. Credential
resolution uses a `credential-cmd` field that executes a shell
command and injects the output into the source URL's userinfo.
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 2)

### Inherited global WorkerMessages channel
**Decision:** Keep aerc's package-level `types.WorkerMessages` channel
for now. Known limitation: multiple adapters would race on this
channel.
**Rationale:** Refactoring to per-worker channels requires changes
across the entire forked worker codebase. Single-account use (Passes
2-10) is unaffected. Will need to be addressed for multi-account
support in Pass 11.
**Date:** 2026-04-09 (Pass 2)

### Better Pine, not Better Mutt
**Decision:** Poplar is opinionated and visually attractive out of
the box. Not configurable in v1. Users who want maximum
configurability should use aerc or mutt.
**Rationale:** Lowest possible learning curve for a vim-literate
user. Pine's "it just works" philosophy with modern aesthetics.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Idiomatic bubbletea showcase
**Decision:** Poplar code should be reference-quality bubbletea.
When there's a choice between a plain approach and one that
demonstrates a compelling framework capability, lean toward the
showcase — as long as it serves the UX.
**Rationale:** Attract bubbletea contributors. Prove the framework
scales to a real, complex application. Extractable patterns (theme
bridge, Catkin editor, inline compose, toast system) benefit the
community.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Vim-first keybindings
**Decision:** Single-key vim motions (j/k, G, C-d/C-u, C-f/C-b),
vim visual mode for multi-select (v). Folder jumps via command
mode. Not configurable in v1.
**Rationale:** Vim motions are the universal TUI convention (mutt,
aerc, lazygit, k9s all agree). Assuming vim literacy lets the
command footer focus on email-specific actions instead of wasting
space on navigation hints.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Curated command footer over full help
**Decision:** Footer shows only email-specific keybindings (triage,
reply, compose, search, command). Vim navigation and thread folding
are silent. Full reference via `?` popover.
**Rationale:** Vim users don't need to be told about j/k. Footer
real estate is precious — use it for email workflow discovery. The
`?` popover provides the complete reference when needed.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Folder groups without headers
**Decision:** Three folder groups (Primary, Disposal, Custom)
separated by blank lines in the sidebar. No rendered group headers.
**Rationale:** The grouping is self-evident from folder names and
icons. Headers would label the obvious and add visual noise. Groups
exist in the data model for sort order and folder jump targeting
(via command mode).
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Provider folder name normalization
**Decision:** Poplar displays canonical folder names (Inbox, Sent,
Trash) regardless of provider naming ([Gmail]/Sent Mail, Sent Items,
etc.). Recognition via case-insensitive matching against known
aliases.
**Rationale:** Users shouldn't see provider implementation details.
Canonical names work across providers and match command mode
jump targets.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Hand-rolled sidebar over bubbles/list
**Decision:** Sidebar uses `lipgloss.JoinVertical` with custom
row rendering, not `bubbles/list`.
**Rationale:** `bubbles/list` lacks native section/group support.
Hand-rolled is the idiomatic approach — Charm's own apps use the
same technique for grouped sidebars. Allows full control over
selection styling (left thick border + background fill), unread
count badge alignment, and group spacing.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Mock backend for prototype
**Decision:** `internal/mail/mock.go` implements `mail.Backend`
with hardcoded data. Stays in the codebase permanently.
**Rationale:** Enables the prototype (Pass 2.5b) without backend
dependencies. Useful long-term for development, testing, and demos.
Pass 3 swaps mock for real JMAP adapter — no throwaway code.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### Per-screen prototype sub-passes
**Decision:** Pass 2.5b broken into 7 sub-passes, one screen at a
time: chrome shell, sidebar, message list, viewer, help popover,
status/toast, command mode.
**Rationale:** Each screen is a learning opportunity about bubbletea
idioms. Lessons from building the sidebar inform the message list.
Incremental validation — each sub-pass produces a testable result.
**Date:** 2026-04-10

### No multi-key sequences
**Decision:** Avoid multi-key chords (e.g., `g i`, `g g`) in
bubbletea. Use single-key bindings for all actions.
**Rationale:** Bubbletea sends one `tea.KeyMsg` per keypress.
Multi-key sequences require a custom state machine (pending key
buffer, timeout logic, disambiguation). This is unnecessary
complexity — folder jumps and other multi-key actions belong in
command mode (`:go inbox`) which naturally handles multi-word
input. `G` (shift-g) for jump-to-bottom is fine since it's a
single keypress.
**Date:** 2026-04-10 (Pass 2.5b-2)

### appModel wrapper for tea.Model compliance
**Decision:** `ui.App.Update` returns `(App, tea.Cmd)` (typed, per
Elm convention). The `appModel` wrapper in `cmd/poplar/root.go`
satisfies `tea.Model`'s `(tea.Model, tea.Cmd)` return type. Similarly,
`AccountTab` has a public `Update` returning `(tea.Model, tea.Cmd)`
for the `Tab` interface, plus an internal `updateTab` returning
`(AccountTab, tea.Cmd)` for typed access in tests.
**Rationale:** Keeps the UI layer free of interface-return overhead
while satisfying bubbletea's `tea.Model` contract at the boundary.
This is the standard pattern in the bubbletea ecosystem for apps
with typed model hierarchies.
**Date:** 2026-04-10 (Pass 2.5b-1)

### Drop tabs in favor of sidebar
**Decision:** Remove the tab bar entirely. The sidebar (always
visible) shows folder context. Opening a message renders in the
right panel, not a new tab. `q` returns to the message list.
**Rationale:** With the sidebar always visible, the tab bar
provided no new information while consuming 3 rows. Simplifies
navigation — no tab lifecycle, no `1-9` switching. Aligns with
"Better Pine" philosophy (one thing at a time).
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Three-sided frame with open left edge
**Decision:** Top `──┬──╮`, right `│`, bottom status bar
`──┴──╯`. No left border.
**Rationale:** Distinctive asymmetric frame that avoids the
junction problem at bottom-left where the status bar meets a
left border. The open left edge matches the bottom where the
grey status bar starts at column 0.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Account name in sidebar, switchable
**Decision:** Account name at top of sidebar, one account at a
time, key to cycle between accounts.
**Rationale:** Pine-style simplicity over stacked account trees.
When the sidebar collapses, the top frame line shows
`account · folder` for context.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Colorblind-accessible connection states
**Decision:** Connection states use shape + color + text: `●`
green filled (connected), `○` red hollow (offline), `◐` orange
half (reconnecting).
**Rationale:** Triple redundancy ensures accessibility across
colorblind conditions, monochrome terminals, and screen readers.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Footer group separators
**Decision:** `┊` (U+250A, light quadruple dash vertical) in
`fg_dim` between key groups. Custom rendering, not bubbles/help.
**Rationale:** Subtle enough to recede behind key hints, clear
enough to read groups. Spacing alone was insufficient.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Single-key folder jumps
**Decision:** Uppercase single keys (I/D/S/A/X/T) jump to
canonical folders from any context. Not multi-key sequences.
**Rationale:** Bubbletea sends one KeyMsg per keypress. Multi-key
sequences require a state machine. Uppercase avoids conflict with
lowercase triage keys (d/a/s).
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Catkin: reusable built-in editor
**Decision:** Poplar's built-in compose editor is named Catkin. It lives
in `catkin/` as a standalone, importable bubbletea component with no
poplar dependencies. Email-specific features (reflow, quote handling,
tidytext, spellcheck) are layered on top by poplar's compose panel.
**Rationale:** A premier bubbletea text editor component that others
can import. Keeps the editor focused on editing, the compose panel
focused on email workflow. Extractable to its own repo if it gains
traction.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Catkin: Ctrl+key commands, no multi-key sequences
**Decision:** Catkin is non-modal. All commands use modifier keys
(Ctrl+key) or special keys (arrows, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn). No bare
letter commands, no multi-key sequences. One `tea.KeyMsg` = one action.
**Rationale:** Idiomatic bubbletea. Catkin is always in insert mode —
bare keys are text input. The spirit is vim-flavored (efficient,
keyboard-driven, no mouse required) but the grammar is Ctrl+key like
pico/micro. Consistent with poplar's global "no multi-key sequences"
rule.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Two-editor architecture with Editor interface
**Decision:** Compose supports two editor backends behind an `Editor`
interface: Catkin (v1 default) and neovim via `--embed` RPC (v1.1).
Config selects the editor. The compose panel, header region, lifecycle,
and send pipeline are shared.
**Rationale:** Catkin provides an out-of-the-box experience for
everyone. Neovim embedding is the 1.1 killer feature — inline nvim in
the right panel while sidebar and chrome stay visible. No terminal
email client does this today. The `Editor` interface is designed in v1
so the neovim implementation slots in without refactoring.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Inline compose over terminal takeover
**Decision:** Compose renders in the right panel. Sidebar, top line,
status bar, and footer remain visible and active with compose-appropriate
content. No `tea.ExecProcess` terminal takeover.
**Rationale:** Every terminal email client today shells out and loses
context. Keeping the chrome visible during compose is the differentiating
UX feature. The header region is native bubbletea (not part of the
editor), the editor fills the remaining space.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Sidebar as child model, not inline rendering
**Decision:** Sidebar is a standalone `Sidebar` struct in
`internal/ui/sidebar.go` with its own `View()`, navigation methods,
and style-aware rendering. `AccountTab` owns it as a child model
and delegates key events via `handleSidebarKey`.
**Rationale:** The chrome shell pass (2.5b-1) had inline sidebar
rendering in `AccountTab.renderSidebar`. Extracting to a child model
follows Elm architecture (each component owns its state and view),
makes the sidebar independently testable, and prepares for the
message list component to follow the same pattern.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-2)

### Selection background via style composition
**Decision:** Selected rows apply `bg_selection` by passing a
`bgStyle lipgloss.Style` into `renderRow`. Each text segment
uses `withBg(baseStyle)` to layer the background on top of its
foreground color. Two `bgStyle` variants (plain and selected)
are computed once in `View()` and passed per-row.
**Rationale:** Lipgloss doesn't support layering backgrounds on
already-rendered ANSI text. The alternative — re-rendering each
segment with `style.Background()` — requires every render call
to know about selection state. Passing `bgStyle` as a parameter
keeps selection logic in `View()` and rendering logic in
`renderRow()`.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-2)

### Codified semantic styling reference
**Decision:** `docs/poplar/styling.md` is the authoritative map
from every `Styles` field to its palette slot and semantic role.
Before changing any color in `internal/ui/styles.go`, the doc is
updated first. Components never call `lipgloss.NewStyle()` directly
or reach into `CompiledTheme` — they pull from the `Styles` struct.
**Rationale:** Repeated "fix this color" iterations kept churning
the same fields in different directions because there was no
single-source-of-truth for which semantic role each slot served.
The doc locks in roles (e.g., "sidebar rows always use `BgElevated`
as their background") independent of the current theme's hex
values. Themes can evolve without scavenging callsites, and color
changes become deliberate edits to a documented contract rather
than ad-hoc tweaks.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-2)

### One pane, no focus cycling (like pine)
**Decision:** The account view is a single pane from a keyboard nav
standpoint. No Tab focus cycling between sidebar and message list.
Every key is always live: `j/k` navigate messages, `J/K` navigate
folders, triage/reply keys act on the current message. The footer
has a single `AccountContext` — it only changes when the viewer
opens over the list.
**Rationale:** Focus cycling is a vestige of the mutt-style two-pane
mental model. Pine treats the screen as one thing. With distinct
keybindings (j/k vs J/K), there's no ambiguity — keys dispatch by
identity, not by "which panel is active". Removed the `Panel` type,
`SidebarPanel`/`MsgListPanel` constants, Tab key handler,
`SidebarContext`/`SidebarKeys`, and the sidebar `focused` field.
The `┃` selection indicator always renders on the selected folder.
Simplifies both the mental model and the code.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-2 refinement)

### 15 compiled themes with One Dark default
**Decision:** Ship 15 compiled themes (10 dark, 5 light). Default is
One Dark. Selection criteria: terminal ecosystem presence (kitty/alacritty
ports minimum) with popularity as tiebreaker.
**Rationale:** One Dark is neutral and familiar to millions of VS Code
users. The 15-theme lineup covers every major terminal color scheme
family. All themes are compiled Go values — no runtime config files.
`poplar themes` subcommand lists available themes.
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Responsive footer with per-hint drop ranks
**Decision:** Footer hints carry per-hint `dropRank` (0–10).
When the terminal is too narrow to fit the full hint list, the
footer progressively drops the highest-rank hints until the
content fits. Rank 0 hints (`? help`, `q quit`) are pinned and
never drop. Groups whose hints all drop also collapse their
preceding `┊` separator.
**Rationale:** A pure "hide whole groups" responsive scheme is
too coarse — at borderline widths you'd lose `r/R reply` along
with the rest of the compose group when only `f fwd` needed to
go. Per-hint ranks let the footer degrade by individual
affordance: nav (vim convention) drops first, then niche modes
(`v select`, `n/N results`), then secondary actions (`.`, `s`,
`f`, `/`), keeping the primary email loop (`d`, `a`, `r/R`, `c`)
plus the always-pinned `? help / q quit` escape hatch even at
40 columns. Implemented in `internal/ui/footer.go` —
`fitFooterHints` drops one hint at a time and re-measures until
the rendered plain-text width fits.
**Note:** Originally pinned `: cmd` alongside `? help` and
`q quit` in rank 0. Command mode was dropped entirely on
2026-04-12, so the rank-0 set shrank to two hints.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (updated 2026-04-12)

### Message list as child model with viewport offset
**Decision:** Message list is a standalone `MessageList` struct in
`internal/ui/msglist.go` with its own `View()`, cursor state
(`selected`), viewport state (`offset`), and movement methods
(`MoveDown`/`MoveUp`/`MoveToTop`/`MoveToBottom`/`HalfPageDown`/`HalfPageUp`/
`PageDown`/`PageUp`). All movement routes through a single `moveBy(delta)`
helper that clamps the cursor and re-clamps the viewport. `AccountTab`
owns it as a child model alongside `Sidebar` and dispatches keys by
identity (`j/k` to msglist, `J/K` to sidebar) — no focus switching.
**Rationale:** Same Elm-architecture pattern as the sidebar (Pass
2.5b-2). Hand-rolled (not `bubbles/list`) for the same reasons: full
control over the `▐` cursor cell, selection background composition,
and hand-tuned column layout. Viewport offset (`clampOffset`) is
needed because the message list scrolls — the sidebar doesn't.
Folder changes via J/K refresh the message list through
`AccountTab.loadSelectedFolder` (mock-backed for the prototype, real
JMAP/IMAP in Pass 3).
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-3)

### Flag cell width measured by lipgloss, not visual cells
**Decision:** The message list flag column is **1 lipgloss cell wide**,
not 2. The wireframe shows Nerd Font glyphs (`󰇮 󰑚 󰈻`) as 2 visual
cells, but `lipgloss.Width()` reports them as 1 cell. All column-width
math (`mlFixedWidth`, padding) uses lipgloss cells; an empty flag
slot is one space, not two.
**Rationale:** Initial implementation assumed visual width and
mismatched the math, producing right-edge misalignment between rows
with icons and rows without. Lipgloss is the source of truth for
character cell math because it's what computes every padding and
join in the rendered output. Visual width is only relevant for
human-eye verification of the live render. Documented inline in
`mlFixedWidth` so future contributors don't repeat the mistake.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-3)

### Shared `applyBg` helper for row background composition
**Decision:** The closure that layers a row's background color onto a
foreground style — previously duplicated as `withBg` inside both
`sidebar.go:renderRow` and `msglist.go:renderRow` — is now a single
package-level helper `applyBg(base, bgStyle)` in `styles.go`. Both
components call `applyBg(s.styles.X, bgStyle).Render(...)` instead of
defining the closure inline.
**Rationale:** The closure body was byte-for-byte identical in both
files. Future row-rendering components (message viewer header,
threaded reply panel) will need the same composition. A free function
is shorter at the call site, eliminates the per-row closure
allocation, and simplifies `renderFlagCell`'s signature (no need to
thread the closure as a parameter).
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-3)

### Message list color: brightness, not hue
**Decision:** Read state in the message list is encoded by brightness
(`FgBright` for unread, `FgDim` for read), not by hue. Glyphs carry
the flag/answered/unread distinction. Color hue is reserved for the
two states that genuinely demand attention: the cursor (`AccentPrimary`
on `▐`) and the unread+flagged row (`ColorWarning` on the `󰈻`
glyph). A read+flagged row dims the flag glyph along with the rest of
the row — read state always wins over flag state for color. Replaced
the per-flag-type hue scheme (`MsgListFlagUnread` teal +
`MsgListFlagAnswered` purple + `MsgListFlagFlagged` orange) with two
brightness-based icon styles (`MsgListIconUnread` /
`MsgListIconRead`) plus the narrowed `MsgListFlagFlagged` for the
single attention-worthy combination.
**Rationale:** The earlier scheme used four hues per row (cursor blue
+ unread teal + answered purple + flagged orange) on a muted Nord
background. No single element won the eye, and the row read as
garish. This is Tufte's data-ink principle applied to color: spend
hue on the data that demands attention, withhold it everywhere else.
Apple Mail, Fastmail, Gmail, and Mutt all encode unread by brightness
or weight, not hue — the convention exists because it works. The
general rule is now codified in the `bubbletea-design` skill's "Hue
Budget" subsection so future TUI work picks it up automatically;
the poplar-specific application lives in `docs/poplar/styling.md`.
**Date:** 2026-04-11 (Pass 2.5b-3)

### Threading default: on globally, per-folder override
**Decision:** Threaded display is enabled by default for every
folder. A per-folder `[ui.folders.<name>]` override flips an
individual folder to flat. There is no per-account granularity —
poplar is a single-account-at-a-time UI.
**Rationale:** Matches the default state shown in
`wireframes.md` §3, matches the expectation every user brings
from Fastmail web, Apple Mail, and Gmail, and is simpler than
aerc's opt-in model. "Better Pine" means Pine UX polish, not
Pine defaults — pine's defaults lost the war against modern
mail clients, and poplar shouldn't inherit them just for
historical fidelity. The per-folder override is cheap and
covers the "this folder reads better chronologically" case.
**Date:** 2026-04-12 (Pass 2.5b-3.5 brainstorm)

### Sidebar folder groups are load-bearing
**Decision:** The Primary / Disposal / Custom three-group
structure of the sidebar is permanent, not a default the user
can flatten. Poplar always renders Primary first, then
Disposal, then Custom, separated by blank lines. User config
assigns an in-group rank to folders but cannot move a folder
across groups. Canonical folders keep their canonical order
unless explicitly reranked. Custom folders alphabetize by
default; user can override with explicit ranks.
**Rationale:** The grouping prevents accidental navigation
into personal folders when scrolling past Trash, and the
wireframe looks good because of it. Letting users flatten the
groups would allow them to shoot off their own feet for no
clear win. Keeping the groups rigid doesn't cost flexibility
that actually matters — within-group ranking covers every
real reorder use case (pin `Lists/golang` to the top of Custom,
push `Notifications` down, etc.). The simpler invariant also
makes the sidebar renderer easier to reason about.
**Date:** 2026-04-12 (Pass 2.5b-3.5 brainstorm)

### Nested folders render flat with one-space indent
**Decision:** Folders whose names contain `/` (e.g.
`Lists/golang`, `Projects/Acme`) get one extra leading space
in the sidebar. No tree view, no expand/collapse. Adjacent
siblings are still kept adjacent by the alphabetical sort
within the Custom group — the indent is pure render polish on
top of the flat data model.
**Rationale:** The three-level-deep hierarchies typical of
real Fastmail/Gmail accounts need *some* visual signal that
`Lists/golang` and `Lists/rust` are siblings. A one-space
indent is subtle enough to read as "these things are related"
without implying an interactive tree. Tree view was explicitly
rejected at Pass 2.5b-2 (aerc tried it, its `app/dirtree.go`
sorts children alphabetically ignoring `folders-sort`, and
the complexity-to-benefit ratio is bad). The indent costs
nothing — one character per nested row, no data-model change,
no new navigation rules.

### Drop `:` command mode
**Decision:** Poplar does not have a `:` command line. Every
action is bound to a key, or is invoked by a key that opens a
modal picker (folder move/copy, search, etc.). Pass 7 in
`STATUS.md` shrinks from "Command mode + search" to just
"Search."
**Rationale:** Every use case for `:` in the wireframes has a
more direct path: folder jumps use single uppercase keys
(`I`/`D`/`S`/`A`/`X`/`T`), move/copy open a folder picker
modal via a key, `/` starts search, `Esc` clears it. A hidden
command layer would double the discoverability surface — users
would have to learn keys *and* command names with no clear
rule for which is authoritative — and it contradicts the
curated-footer philosophy. Pine doesn't have one. Removing it
also frees a full column from the footer on narrow terminals.
If a typed-input affordance turns out to be necessary later
for some action that can't be a key or a modal, we can add it
back — removing a key is cheap, and re-adding one is cheap too.

### Multi-select deferred to Pass 6; `v`/`Space` reserved
**Decision:** The `v`-enters-visual-select multi-select design
from `wireframes.md` §16 is deferred to Pass 6 (triage
actions). `v` and `Space` stay in `keybindings.md` as reserved
but marked deferred. Neither key does anything in v1 until
Pass 6 lands.
**Rationale:** Multi-select is a non-trivial feature
(selection state, footer swap, bulk action application) that
belongs with the triage pass where bulk delete/archive
actually matters. Reserving the keys now prevents later passes
from grabbing them for unrelated features. This is also the
one narrow place where poplar accepts modality — `v` enters a
mode where `Space` toggles row selection — and that acceptance
is load-bearing for the keybinding design (e.g., `Space` is
not free for thread-fold toggle, which forces the fold-key
question onto other keys like `Tab`).

### First `[ui]` config section
**Decision:** `~/.config/poplar/accounts.toml` gains a `[ui]`
table with a global `threading` default and
`[ui.folders.<name>]` subsections for per-folder overrides
(threading, sort, rank, possibly hide). This is the first
non-account config section in poplar and sets the pattern for
future UI-tuning sections.
**Rationale:** Folder display behavior is UI concern, not
account concern, so it belongs outside the `[[account]]`
block. Keying the per-folder overrides on the folder name
(not a glob) keeps the initial implementation simple — globs
can come later if there's demand. The exact field names and
types are still subject to brainstorm refinement (see
STATUS.md "Still open" list), but the location and shape of
the section is fixed.

### Pass 2.5b-3.5 split: config/sidebar vs threading/fold
**Decision:** The "threaded view + UI config" pass is split
along its natural seam. Pass 2.5b-3.5 becomes "UI config +
sidebar polish + docs cleanup" — first `[ui]` section, folder
auto-discovery, group classification, within-group ranking,
nested one-space indent, keybindings-doc cleanup. Pass 2.5b-3.6
becomes "threading + fold (index view completion)" — thread
fields on `mail.MessageInfo`, `├─ └─ │` prefixes, per-thread
fold state, `Space`/`F`/`U` keys, `[N]` collapsed badge, sort
interaction. 3.5 parses and stores the threading config fields
but has no consumer until 3.6.
**Rationale:** The original bundled scope had three unrelated
themes (threading render, config, docs cleanup) held together
only by the fact that the per-folder threading override lives
in the config section. Splitting gives each pass a single
sentence of description ("poplar understands UI config and
renders the sidebar right" vs "poplar threads and folds"),
lets 3.5 ship visible value standalone (real folder hierarchy
rendered correctly), and turns 3.6 from a two-key follow-up
into a proper pass that captures all the work genuinely
entangled with fold (data model, render, navigation, sort,
collapsed badge). The cost — fields parsed in 3.5 that sit
unused for one pass — is a well-established Go pattern and
much smaller than the cost of bundling themes that don't share
rationale.

### Thread fold key: `Space`, dual meaning in visual-select mode
**Decision:** `Space` is the thread fold-toggle key when
outside visual-select mode. Inside visual-select mode (Pass 6)
`Space` retains its reserved role as the row-toggle key. The
two meanings are disambiguated by mode — visual-select already
changes the footer, row highlighting, and the set of "live"
triage keys, so a key meaning different things inside vs.
outside that mode is consistent with the mode design rather
than an exception to it. The two actions don't overlap in
practice either: users don't fold threads while building a
multi-message triage set.
**Rationale:** `Space` has the stronger claim from user
expectation — ranger, nnn, lazygit, k9s, and most
file-manager-adjacent TUIs use `Space` for "fold/toggle
whatever's under the cursor". The earlier reservation of
`Space` exclusively for multi-select (STATUS.md pre-split)
was defensible but not load-bearing: `m`, `x`, or a vim-style
range model would all work for multi-select's per-row toggle,
and none is actively better than `Space`. The "single meaning
per key" rule is about forbidding hidden contextual shifts
*within* a single mode, not about forbidding modes from
changing what keys mean — that's literally what a mode is.
`Tab` was the other serious candidate; it was passed over
because it already means "link picker" in the viewer context,
which creates the same kind of split without the upside of
matching modern-client fold convention.
**Date:** 2026-04-12 (Pass 2.5b-3.5 brainstorm)

### Fold-all / unfold-all: `F` / `U`, Pass 2.5b-3.6
**Decision:** `F` (fold-all) and `U` (unfold-all) are the
reserved keys for bulk fold actions. Both ship in Pass
2.5b-3.6 alongside the per-thread `Space` toggle, not before.
Neither is bound in Pass 2.5b-3.5; `keybindings.md` marks them
reserved and points at 3.6 as the delivery pass.
**Rationale:** Fold-all is the primary bulk action users will
reach for ("walk into a busy folder, collapse everything,
skim roots"). Unfold-all is rarer but cheap to ship once
fold-all exists. Capital letters were chosen to pair with
lowercase `Space` — uppercase single keys are the poplar idiom
for "same action, bigger scope" (cf. `J/K` vs `j/k`, `R` vs
`r`). `Shift-Space` was considered and rejected because many
terminal emulators drop the shift modifier on bare space and
send plain space instead — the keypress is not reliable
cross-platform. Fold-all / unfold-all are a blocker for "index
view done," not polish, which is why 3.6 exists as a dedicated
pass rather than a post-hoc follow-up.
**Date:** 2026-04-12 (Pass 2.5b-3.5 brainstorm)

### Runtime threading toggle: dropped
**Decision:** Poplar has no single-key runtime threading
toggle (e.g. "flat view just for this session"). Threading is
controlled entirely via config — the global `threading`
default and per-folder `[ui.folders.<name>] threading = false`
overrides.
**Rationale:** Once a user has tuned per-folder threading
preferences, runtime flipping becomes noise — the
Inbox-set-flat user never wants Inbox threaded, the
Archive-set-threaded user never wants Archive flat. YAGNI. If
a compelling runtime use case turns up during real daily use,
adding a key later is cheap. Better Pine means fewer knobs,
not more.
