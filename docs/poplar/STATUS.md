## Next starter prompt (Pass 2.5b-3.6)

> **Goal.** Complete the index view with threaded display, per-thread
> fold state, and bulk fold/unfold.
>
> **Scope.** Thread fields on `mail.MessageInfo` (thread id, parent
> ref, depth). Mock backend grows one threaded conversation. Render
> `├─ └─ │` prefixes in the subject column in `FgDim` — document the
> new style slot(s) in `docs/poplar/styling.md` before writing
> renderer code. Per-thread fold state on `MessageList` with `Space`
> (fold-toggle), `F` (fold-all), `U` (unfold-all). `j/k` skips hidden
> children. Collapsed thread shows `[N]` count badge in `fg_dim`
> before the subject. Consume the `[ui.folders.<name>] threading`
> field Pass 2.5b-3.5 parsed. Thread roots sort by the folder's
> existing sort order; children always chronological ascending.
> Footer gains the fold hint; `keybindings.md` promotes
> `Space`/`F`/`U` from reserved to live.
>
> **Settled (do not re-brainstorm):** `Space` fold-toggle outside
> visual mode, row-toggle inside it. `F`/`U` for bulk fold — Shift-
> Space rejected because terminals drop the modifier. No runtime
> threading toggle — config only. Threading default on globally,
> per-folder override. Thread prefixes `├─ └─ │` in `FgDim`.
>
> **Still open — brainstorm these:** sort confirmation; data model
> shape (fields on `MessageInfo` vs sibling `ThreadInfo` type);
> fold state model (per-session vs persisted, default on open);
> thread root identification (earliest vs topmost in sort order);
> mock backend threaded conversation content.
>
> **Approach.** Brainstorm the open questions, write a plan doc at
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-poplar-threading.md`, then
> implement. Pass-end ritual: invoke the `poplar-pass` skill.

## Pass 2.5b-train details

Tooling pass — not a UX prototype. Slotted before 2.5b-4 because
the viewer's `b` capture key reuses `internal/train.Save`, so
building training first means zero rework when the viewer lands,
and the fix-corpus loop is already triaging the 45 pre-migrated
audit-output captures by the time viewer development starts
surfacing new rendering bugs.

- **Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-mailrender-training-design.md`
- **Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-13-mailrender-training.md`
- **Builds:** `internal/train/`, `internal/content/markdown.go`,
  `cmd/poplar/train.go`, `.claude/skills/fix-corpus/` (directory
  skill with normative reference), `docs/poplar/training.md`,
  ADR 0059, plus updates to invariants/system-map/CLAUDE.md.
- **Dependencies:** `internal/filter`, `internal/content`,
  `internal/mailworker/xdg` — all already shipped.
- **Build approach:** subagent-driven-development on the plan
  above, 26 tasks across 8 phases, fresh subagent per task.
