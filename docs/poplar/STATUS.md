# Poplar Status

**Current state:** Message list prototype complete. Hand-rolled
`MessageList` component in `internal/ui/msglist.go` with column
layout (cursor / flag / sender(22) / subject(fill) / date(12)), `▐`
cursor on the selected row, viewport scrolling
(`MoveDown`/`MoveUp`/`MoveToTop`/`MoveToBottom` plus `HalfPage` and
`Page` Up/Down — all routed through a single `moveBy` helper).
**Brightness, not hue:** read rows render in `FgDim`, unread in
`FgBright` (sender bold), the flag glyph dims with the row, and
`ColorWarning` is reserved for the single unread+flagged case. The
cursor `▐` is the only other place hue is used. Glyphs `󰈻 󰑚 󰇮`
carry the flag/answered/unread distinction; color carries the "demands
attention" signal. Codified as a general TUI rule in the
`bubbletea-design` skill ("Hue Budget") and as the poplar-specific map
in `docs/poplar/styling.md`. Folder changes via J/K refresh the
message list through `AccountTab.loadSelectedFolder` (mock-backed;
Pass 3 wires real JMAP). Single-pane key dispatch: `j/k` move
messages, `J/K/G` move folders, every key always live. Shared
`applyBg` and `fillRowToWidth` helpers extracted from sidebar and
msglist row renderers. Flag cell width pinned to **1 lipgloss cell**
— visual width vs `lipgloss.Width()` mismatch is documented inline.
Ready for message viewer prototype (Pass 2.5b-4).

## Continuing Development

### Next steps

1. **Execute Pass 2.5b-3.5** — UI config + sidebar polish + docs cleanup
2. **Execute Pass 2.5b-3.6** — threading + fold (index view completion)

### Next starter prompt

> Start Pass 2.5b-3.5: UI config + sidebar polish + keybindings-doc
> cleanup. This pass adds the first `[ui]` section to
> `~/.config/poplar/accounts.toml`, uses it to auto-discover and
> rank folders in the sidebar, renders nested folders with a
> one-space indent, and finishes the keybindings-doc cleanup.
> **Threading render, fold state, and the `Space`/`F`/`U` keys all
> belong to the next pass (2.5b-3.6), not this one.** Schema
> fields for threading are still parsed and stored in this pass —
> they sit unused in `UIConfig` until 2.5b-3.6 wires the consumer.
>
> **Open this session by brainstorming the open questions below.**
> Read the wireframes at `docs/poplar/wireframes.md` (§2 sidebar
> and §3 message list), the architecture doc at
> `docs/poplar/architecture.md` (especially "Sidebar folder groups
> are load-bearing", "Nested folders render flat with one-space
> indent", "First `[ui]` config section", and the new "Pass
> 2.5b-3.5 split" decision), the keybindings doc at
> `docs/poplar/keybindings.md`, the styling reference at
> `docs/poplar/styling.md`, and the existing sidebar code at
> `internal/ui/sidebar.go`.
>
> **Goal.** Three things land in this pass:
>
> 1. **First `[ui]` section** in `~/.config/poplar/accounts.toml`,
>    parsed into a `UIConfig` struct, threaded through `App` →
>    `AccountTab` → children as read-only at construction. Global
>    defaults plus per-folder overrides
>    (`[ui.folders.<name>] rank = N, threading = false, sort = ...`).
>    Threading-related fields are parsed and stored this pass but
>    have no consumer until 2.5b-3.6.
> 2. **Sidebar polish**: folder auto-discovery,
>    Primary/Disposal/Custom group classification, within-group
>    ranking by `rank` field, alphabetical fallback in the Custom
>    group, one-space indent for folders whose names contain `/`.
> 3. **Keybindings doc cleanup**: drop remaining `:` references,
>    mark `v`/`Space` as reserved (deferred to Pass 6 / 2.5b-3.6),
>    mark `F`/`U` as reserved (deferred to 2.5b-3.6), resolve
>    remaining wireframe TBDs about fold keys by pointing at
>    2.5b-3.6, confirm the footer drop-rank table is still
>    accurate.
>
> ---
>
> **Settled (do not re-brainstorm):**
>
> - Pass scope is split — threading render and fold state are
>   **not** in this pass. See architecture.md "Pass 2.5b-3.5
>   split".
> - Sidebar groups are load-bearing (Primary / Disposal / Custom).
>   User config ranks *within* a group; folders cannot move across
>   groups.
> - Canonical folders keep their canonical order unless explicitly
>   reranked; custom folders alphabetize by default.
> - Nested folders get a one-space indent, no tree view.
> - `[ui]` is the first non-account config section; the pattern it
>   establishes will be reused for future UI-tuning sections.
> - `:` command mode is dropped entirely — every action is a key
>   or a modal picker.
>
> ---
>
> **Still open — brainstorm these first:**
>
> - **Exact config field names, types, defaults.** Settle the
>   global fields (`threading`, maybe `folder-order`, maybe a hide
>   list), the per-folder fields (`rank`, `threading`, `sort`,
>   maybe `hide`), and their types (int rank vs float rank, string
>   sort vs enum).
> - **Folder auto-discovery and classification rules.** How does
>   poplar decide which provider folder is "Inbox" — role attr,
>   canonical name match, alias list? How are `[Gmail]/Sent Mail`,
>   `Sent Items`, etc. mapped to canonical names? Is
>   classification done in `internal/mail/` or `internal/poplar/`?
>   Does the mock backend need to exercise the classifier?
> - **Within-group rank semantics.** Positive int? Floats for
>   insertion? Ties broken alphabetically? Is negative rank valid
>   (pin-to-bottom)?
> - **`[ui.folders.<name>]` key: canonical or provider name?**
>   Canonical is more portable across providers; provider is more
>   literal. Pick one and document.
> - **Nested indent: one level or scales with depth?**
>   `Lists/golang` is one indent. Would `Projects/Acme/Planning`
>   be two indents, or still just one?
> - **Hide folders via config?** Some users have provider-injected
>   folders they never want to see (e.g. `[Gmail]/All Mail`).
>   Include a hide mechanism now or defer?
> - **Where does `UIConfig` live?** `internal/poplar/ui_config.go`
>   alongside `AccountConfig`, or a new `internal/config/` package?
> - **Exact delta for keybindings-doc cleanup.** The doc is
>   mostly clean — confirm what still needs to change.
>
> **Approach.** Brainstorm the open questions above, then write a
> short plan doc at
> `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-poplar-ui-config.md`, then
> implement. Standard pass-end checklist applies.

### Follow-up starter prompt (Pass 2.5b-3.6)

> After Pass 2.5b-3.5 lands, resume with Pass 2.5b-3.6: threading
> display + fold state + index-view completion. Read the
> wireframes at `docs/poplar/wireframes.md` (§3 message list,
> §7 screen state #14 threaded view), the architecture doc at
> `docs/poplar/architecture.md` (especially the threading/sidebar
> decisions, the Pass split decision, the Space-fold-key decision,
> and the F/U reservation), the keybindings doc at
> `docs/poplar/keybindings.md`, and the existing `MessageList`
> code at `internal/ui/msglist.go`. Pass 2.5b-3.5 already parses
> the threading config fields — this pass wires the consumer.
>
> **Goal.** This pass completes the index view:
>
> 1. Thread fields on `mail.MessageInfo` (thread id, parent ref,
>    depth) and the mock backend gains at least one threaded
>    conversation.
> 2. Render `├─ └─ │` prefixes in the subject column in `FgDim`.
>    Document new style slot(s) in `docs/poplar/styling.md`
>    **before** writing renderer code (doc-first rule).
> 3. Per-thread fold state on `MessageList`. Fold-toggle with
>    `Space` (outside visual mode), fold-all with `F`, unfold-all
>    with `U`. `j/k` skips hidden children. Cursor never lands on
>    a collapsed child. Collapsed thread shows `[N]` count badge
>    in `fg_dim` before the subject.
> 4. Consume the `[ui.folders.<name>] threading = ...` field that
>    Pass 2.5b-3.5 parsed. Flip threading on/off per folder.
> 5. Sort interaction: thread roots sort by the folder's existing
>    sort order (one knob), children always render chronological
>    ascending. No separate thread-activity sort.
> 6. Footer gains the fold hint; `keybindings.md` promotes
>    `Space`/`F`/`U` from reserved to live.
>
> ---
>
> **Settled (do not re-brainstorm):**
>
> - `Space` is the fold key outside visual mode; inside visual
>   mode (Pass 6) `Space` toggles row selection — disambiguated
>   by mode. See architecture.md "Thread fold key: Space, dual
>   meaning in visual-select mode".
> - `F` (fold-all) and `U` (unfold-all) are the reserved keys for
>   bulk fold, shipping in this pass. Shift-Space was rejected
>   because terminals don't send it reliably.
> - No runtime threading toggle — config only. See architecture.md
>   "Runtime threading toggle: dropped".
> - Threading default ON globally, per-folder override via the
>   `[ui.folders.<name>]` subsection 2.5b-3.5 establishes.
> - Thread prefixes use box-drawing `├─ └─ │` in `FgDim` per the
>   wireframe.
>
> ---
>
> **Still open — brainstorm these:**
>
> - **Sort interaction confirmation.** Folder's existing sort
>   setting orders thread roots (by root date), children always
>   chronological ascending. The alternative — threading overrides
>   folder sort, always uses latest-activity ordering — was
>   discussed and the one-knob model is the lean. Confirm before
>   implementing.
> - **Data model shape.** Thread id / parent ref / depth as fields
>   on `mail.MessageInfo`, or a sibling `ThreadInfo` type? JMAP
>   supplies thread info natively; IMAP needs Message-ID /
>   References header parsing (Pass 8 concern).
> - **Fold state model.** Per-session in-memory only, or
>   persisted? Default fold state when opening a folder (all
>   unfolded? previous state? all folded if threading is on?).
> - **Thread root identification.** The earliest message in the
>   thread, or the topmost in current sort order? Determines which
>   message stays visible when the thread is collapsed.
> - **Mock backend threaded conversation content.** The wireframe
>   shows Frank Lee → Grace Kim → Frank Lee; reuse that or pick
>   a different example.
>
> **Approach.** Brainstorm the open questions, then write a plan
> doc at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-12-poplar-threading.md`,
> then implement. Standard pass-end checklist applies.

### Pass-end checklist
