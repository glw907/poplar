title: Fold state is per-session, reset on folder reload

## Context

Per-thread fold state has to live somewhere. The options were:
persisted on disk (across runs of poplar), persisted across
folder switches in one session, or reset on every folder load.
Persistence-across-runs adds storage complexity and a stale-key
problem (folded UIDs that no longer exist). Persistence-across-
folder-switches needs a per-folder map and a folder→state
lookup. Reset-on-reload is the simplest model and matches the
behavior of every other terminal mail client we looked at.

Threads also default to expanded — folding is a deliberate user
gesture, not the default state. A user who walks into a folder
expects to see the conversation contents.

## Decision

`MessageList` holds `folded map[mail.UID]bool` keyed by thread
root UID. `SetMessages` resets the map (alongside cursor and
viewport). Default state is expanded — only roots explicitly
toggled by `Space` or `F` appear in the map.

`Space` toggles a single thread root. `F` (`ToggleFoldAll`) is
the bulk counterpart: if any multi-message thread is currently
unfolded it sets every root to `folded[UID] = true`, otherwise
it replaces the map with an empty one. Mixed state collapses
first — matches the common "reset the noise, then open what I'm
reading" flow.

`AccountTab.folderLoadedMsg` calls `m.msglist.SetMessages(...)`
for every folder load, so the reset is automatic — no special
case in the AccountTab.

## Consequences

- Folder switches always show fully expanded threads. Users who
  habitually fold long conversations re-fold after every switch.
  This is a deliberate trade for simplicity; if it becomes
  annoying we revisit with per-folder state.
- The `folded` map can grow to at most `T` entries (one per
  thread root in the current folder). The unfold branch of
  `ToggleFoldAll` releases the whole map; switching folders does
  the same via `SetMessages`.
- No serialization layer for fold state to maintain. No
  migration path to worry about when `UID` semantics change
  across backends.
