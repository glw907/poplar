## High

- [x] **#7** Lipgloss renderer: missing first-level blockquote wrapping `#rendering` `#mailrender` *(2026-04-10)*
  Fixed with two changes: (1) post-parse `wrapImpliedQuotes` wraps unquoted content after a `QuoteAttribution` in a `Blockquote{Level: 1}`, incrementing inner blockquote levels; (2) renderer prefix changed from `strings.Repeat("> ", b.Level)` to `"> "` so structural nesting handles depth without double-counting. Only triggers at top level to avoid compounding. Verified against Yahoo deeply-threaded HTML and plain text emails.

## Someday

- [ ] **#5** Built-in bubbletea compose editor `#poplar` `#v2` *(2026-04-10)*
  Pine-style built-in compose using `bubbles/textarea` for body + custom header fields. Alternative to `$EDITOR` for users who want a seamless, zero-dependency compose experience. Would be a bubbletea showcase piece. Design after external editor flow (Pass 9) is stable.
- [ ] **#6** Neovim companion plugin for poplar `#poplar` `#v2` *(2026-04-10)*
  Email browsing within neovim (folder list, message list, viewer as buffers), telescope pickers, compose integration, poplar command passthrough. Requires IPC/RPC interface in poplar. Design when core client is stable.

## Medium

- [ ] **#8** Design folder jump keybindings without multi-key sequences `#feature` `#poplar` *(2026-04-10)*
  Need single-key alternatives to g-prefix chords (gi/gd/gs/ga/gx/gt) for jumping to Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archive, Spam, Trash. Bubbletea sends one KeyMsg per keypress — multi-key chords require a custom state machine. Options: single-key mnemonics, command mode `:go inbox`, numeric folder indices, or other approaches. Important for daily triage workflow. Deserves its own pass.

- [x] **#1** Clean up pick-link references from live docs `#improvement` `#docs` *(2026-04-09)*
  Binary was archived but `~/.claude/docs/aerc-setup.md` and `CLAUDE.md` still reference it extensively.
- [x] **#2** Clean up stale pandoc references from docs `#improvement` `#docs` *(2026-04-09)*
  pandoc is no longer part of the project but `~/.claude/docs/aerc-setup.md` still references it in the filter pipeline and compose settings.
- [ ] **#4** Investigate JMAP blob preloading for faster message open `#improvement` `#upstream` *(2026-04-09)*
  New messages are slow to open (~6s) because aerc fetches body blobs lazily from Fastmail on first open. `cache-blobs=true` only helps on second open. Investigate whether aerc's JMAP backend supports blob prefetching (e.g., preload next 2-3 messages) or if this needs an upstream aerc patch.
- [x] **#3** ~~Glamour: hanging indent for wrapped list items~~ `#upstream` `#rendering` *(2026-04-09)*
  Obsolete — glamour dependency removed in Pass 2.5-render (lipgloss migration). List items now rendered directly via lipgloss.
